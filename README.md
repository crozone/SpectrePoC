# SpectrePoC

Proof of concept code for the Spectre CPU exploit.

## Attribution

The source code originates from the example code provided in the "Spectre Attacks: Exploiting Speculative Execution" paper found here:

https://spectreattack.com/spectre.pdf

The source code in this repository was conveniently provided by Erik August's gist, found here: https://gist.github.com/ErikAugust/724d4a969fb2c6ae1bbd7b2a9e3d4bb6

The code has been minimally modified to fix build issues and improve comments where possible.

## Building

The project can be built with GNU Make and GCC.

On debian these are included in the `build-essential` metapackage.

Building is as easy as:

`cd SpectrePoC`

`make`

The output binary is `./spectre.out`.

If the target CPU doesn't support the "rdtscp" instruction then the macro "NORDTSCP" must be defined.

`CFLAGS=-DNORDTSCP make`

If you want to build it manually, make sure to disable all optimisations (aka, don't use -O2), as it will break the program.

## Executing

To run specter with the example secret string "The Magic Words are Squeamish Ossifrage." as the target, simply run `./spectre.out` with no command line arguments.

If desired, a custom target address and length can be given as the first and second command line arguments, respectively.

## Tweaking

If you're getting lackluster results, you may need to tweak the `CACHE_HIT_THRESHOLD`. This can be done by changing the line
`#define CACHE_HIT_THRESHOLD (80)`.

While a value of 80 appears to work for most desktop CPUs, a larger value may be required for slower CPUs. For example, on a AMD GX-412TC SOC, a value of 300 was required to get a good result.

## Example output

The following was output on an AMD GX-412TC SOC, with a `CACHE_HIT_THRESHOLD` of 300:

`./spectre.out:`
